  "why": {
    "title": "Why Yurii Primush",
    "text1": "People often say that I’m a big and ambitious dreamer that always makes his dreams true. I believe they are right. By the age of 27 I had achieved most of my childhood dreams.",

When I turned 20, I launched my first start-up which in 10 years grow into one of the most successful ventures in the field, placing it in 4th place in the CEE region. The success helped me to generate significant personal wealth already by the age of 30. I believe that this success was a result of a combination of a good strategic view, creativity, proactivity, scale of thinking, leadership and managerial skills. I’ve been often told to be a good team player and a very empathic person. At the same time, I believe that I can sometimes be very straightforward in my suggestions and opinions.",
    "text3": "I hold an International Economics and MBA degrees. I’m also a certified professional life and business coach, participating regularly in various educational programs. I’m proud to be a client in psychotherapy for the last 5 years. I love working on my personal development which always helps to discover new perspectives pushing me to challenge myself. Working in psychotherapy also helps me not to bring my personal agenda to the sessions with my clients in coaching, so there is full focus on the client and client’s requests",
    "text4": "If you have an idea or a challenge and you dream to change something, to have a more meaningful and successful life, you want to achieve new and exciting goals in your business or in your personal life, I promise to do everything possible to help you on this path."

  "what": {
    "title": "What is coaching",
    "text1": "Coaching is not only a set of tools and techniques that help to unleash your potential. It is also the art of creating a coaching environment for the comprehensive development of the client.",
    "text2": "Coaching is profoundly different from consulting, mentoring, counseling or therapy. The coaching process is about specific personal projects, business successes, general conditions and transitions in a person’s life or relationships. In this process the focus is on analyzing, what is happening right now, learning what the obstacles or challenges may be, and choosing a course of action, that leads to the desired destination.",
    "text3": "Coaching is an alliance between the coach and the client, where the coaching relationship constantly gives all the power to you, the client. I believe that deep inside we know all the answers to our questions, even in situations where there seems no way out. Those answers may be hidden deep inside of us.",
    "text4": "My job is to ask the right questions and provide the right tools and techniques that will allow you to find those answers within yourself.",
    "text5": "You, the client, are the best and the only expert in your life, knowing who you really are and what you need. You are the only expert who can recognize what is best for you. My job is to figure out how to assist you in this through the coaching process.",
    "text6": "Every day we make bigger and smaller decisions. As your coach, I will help you in finding out what your best decision might be. Coaching helps you learn how to make choices that create an effective, balanced and fulfilling life."
